I made this as a reference for myself when it comes to all things kafka and sending messages in different formats.
This is just using a simple string message

I'm testing the various container testing that comes with micronaut.  It was not working for me for the longest time (like 3 days) only to discover that my test services platform was corrupt.  So I simply deleted `~/.micronaut` and it suddenly started working again.

I'm able to easily transfer kafka messages as strings and avro objects - so i'm making this project to just show an example of each type so I don't lose that knowledge in my head.
